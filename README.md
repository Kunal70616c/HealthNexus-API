# HealthNexus-API
HealthNexus-API serves as the primary resource server within a microservices-based Hospital Management System. This service handles core CRUD operations for medical records and patient management while delegating cross-cutting concerns—like routing and authentication—to an external API Gateway and Keycloak server.
